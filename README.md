# Introduction 
Working with location is one of the most common tasks in the development process of mobile apps.
Therefore, questions about what to use to achieve more precise results, maximum stability in operation and 
simplicity of implementation frequently arise during the development.

EasyLocation is built to ease this frequent task by just a few lines of code, But providing a powerful, wide and compat features too.
